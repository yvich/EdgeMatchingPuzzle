# EdgeMatchingPuzzle

after my course in evolutionary algorithm , i want to use different methods to solve the puzzle.

We are making use of genetic operators that are selection  , mutation , crossover ,reproduction ,  evolution , etc
The java classes used are : 

PuzzleBoard: This class would represent the puzzle board and contain methods for initializing the board, mutating the tiles, and evaluating the fitness of a given configuration.

Tile: This class would represent a single puzzle tile and contain properties such as shape and orientation. It would also contain methods for mutating the tile's orientation and checking for edge matching with other tiles.

Population: This class would represent a population of puzzle board configurations and contain methods for selecting the fittest configurations, reproducing new configurations, and evolving the population over time.
